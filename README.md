##  About Me

I am a **Data Analyst and GIS professional** with a background in **Surveying and Geoinformatics**.  
My work focuses on transforming raw and complex datasets into **clear, actionable insights** using data analytics, business intelligence, and spatial analysis techniques.

I enjoy working on problems that require **analytical thinking, pattern discovery, and clear communication of results**, especially where data can support real-world decision-making.

I am currently seeking roles in **Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and GIS Analysis**, where I can apply data-driven insights to support organizations and stakeholders.

##  Flagship Projects

| Project | Problem Solved and Metrics | Tools Used | Report | Preview |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Nigerian Agriculture, Weather & Market Insight (2024–2025)** |Before: Agricultural output, weather conditions, and market prices were analyzed separately, making it difficult to understand their combined impact on food supply and pricing.
After: Integrated agriculture, weather, and market price datasets into a unified analysis, enabling clearer insights into food security trends and price behavior across Nigeria | Power BI, SQL | [View PDF](assets/agridb.pdf) | ![](assets/agridb1.png) ![](assets/agridb2.png) |
| **Nigerian Weather & Traffic Insight** |Before: Weather conditions and traffic congestion data existed independently, with no clear understanding of how weather influenced mobility patterns.
After: Linked weather variables with traffic data to reveal congestion patterns under different weather conditions and improve understanding of urban mobility behavior. | Power BI, SQL, Excel |[View PDF](assets/Nigerian%20Traffic%20data.pdf) | ![](assets/trafficsql-analysis1.png) ![](assets/trafficsql-analysis2.png) ![](assets/trafficsql-analysis3.png) |
| **Lagos State 2024 Health Analysis Insight** | Before: Public health indicators were available as raw figures, making it hard to identify priority areas or trends across the state.
After: Consolidated state-level health indicators for 2024 into analytical dashboards that highlighted trends, disparities, and key areas for health planning. | Power BI, Excel |[View PDF](assets/LUTH%202024%20analysis.pdf) | ![](assets/health-wellness1.png) ![](assets/health-wellness2.png) ![](assets/health-wellness3.png) |
| **2016 Uber Data Insight** | Before: Uber trip records were large and unstructured, limiting visibility into demand patterns and spatial ride behavior.
After: Analyzed 2016 Uber trip data to uncover temporal demand trends and spatial distribution of rides, providing clearer insights into urban mobility patterns. |  Power BI | [View PDF](assets/Uber%20Data%20set%202016.pdf) | ![](assets/uberanalysis1.png) ![](assets/uberanalysis2.png) ![](assets/uberanalysis3.png) |
